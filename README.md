# Deep Learning Project

**Project Description**
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is trained on a dataset organized into train and test directories, using optimized hyperparameters for improved performance.
With 30 epochs, a dense layer of 256 units, and a dropout rate of 0.5, the model achieves good accuracy on the test dataset. Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters or adding more layers.


**Goal**
The main objective was to build and train a deep learning model that can accurately distinguish between cats and dogs based on image features.

**Technologies Used**
- Programming Language: Python  
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy
